      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        <cite>Geolocation</cite> defines a high-level interface to location
        information associated only with the device hosting the implementation.
        Common sources of location information include Global Positioning
        System (GPS) and location inferred from network signals such as IP
        address, RFID, WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, and GSM/CDMA cell IDs,
        as well as user input. The API itself is agnostic of the underlying
        <dfn>location information source</dfn>s, and no guarantee is given that
        the API returns the device's actual location.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification provides two ways for users to share their location:
        a <em>precise position</em> and an <em>approximate position</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>precise position</dfn> is a position returned by the underlying
        [=location information source=]. By default, any location data is
        considered precise, regardless of its accuracy estimate, unless it has
        been explicitly coarsened by an [=approximate location information
        source=] to be an [=approximate position=].
      </p>
      <p>
        An <dfn>approximate position</dfn> is a less precise,
        privacy-preserving representation of the user's location. Instead of
        providing precise coordinates, the user agent MUST return a location
        that is intentionally coarsened to a larger area, such as the nearest
        city, postal code, or a predefined region. This is often sufficient for
        applications that don't need to know the user's [=precise position=],
        for example, a weather application that only needs a city-level
        location. By sharing an [=approximate position=], users can still get
        the benefit of a location-aware application without revealing their
        [=precise position=].
      </p>
      <p>
        An <dfn>approximate location information source</dfn> is a [=location
        information source=] that returns positions that have been
        intentionally obfuscated to make it more difficult to recover the true
        location.

        <cite>Geolocation</cite>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides location data as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and
        heading, as well as the accuracy of the acquired location data, and the
        approximate time for when the position was acquired via the
        {{GeolocationPosition}} interface.
        </li>
        <li>Supports "one-shot" position updates via the
        {{Geolocation/getCurrentPosition()}} method and the ability to receive
        updates for when the position of the hosting device significantly
        changes via the {{Geolocation/watchPosition()}} method.
        </li>
        <li>Using the {{PositionOptions}}'s {{PositionOptions/maximumAge}},
        allows an application to request a cached position whose age is no
        greater than a specified value (only the last position is cached).
        </li>
        <li>Provides a way for the application to receive updates about errors,
        as a {{GeolocationPositionError}}, that have occurred while [=acquiring
        a position=].
        </li>
        <li>And through {{PositionOptions/enableHighAccuracy}}, supports
        requesting "high accuracy" position data, though the request can be
        ignored by the user agent.

          Scope
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification is limited to providing a scripting API for
          retrieving geographic position information associated with a hosting
          device. The geographic position information is provided in terms of
          World Geodetic System coordinates [[WGS84]]. It does not include
          providing a markup language of any kind, nor does not include
          defining a new URL scheme for building URLs that identify geographic
          locations.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>
        Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        The API is designed to enable both "one-shot" position requests and
        repeated position updates. The following examples illustrate common use
        cases.

          get back a position object. The website can influence the position's
          accuracy by using the `accuracyMode` option. By default, the user
          agent will provide a `"precise"` location, but a website can request
          an `"approximate"` location if it doesn't require high accuracy,
          which helps protect user privacy.

          By default, the API always attempts to return a cached position so

        Privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The API defined in this specification is used to retrieve the
        geographic location of a hosting device. In almost all cases, this
        information also discloses the location of the user of the device,
        thereby potentially compromising the user's privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        To mitigate this privacy risk, this specification introduces the
        {{PositionOptions/accuracyMode}} option, which allows the application
        to request an [=approximate position=]. This allows applications to
        function without needing the user's [=precise position=], thus offering
        a more privacy-friendly alternative. When an application requests an
        [=approximate position=], the user agent can provide a less precise
        location that still meets the application's needs while protecting the
        user's [=precise position=]. Even when a [=precise position=] is
        requested, the user agent can provide an [=approximate position=]
        instead, for example, if the user has only granted permission for
        approximate accuracy.

          <cite>Geolocation</cite> is a [=powerful feature=] that requires
          [=express permission=] from an end-user before any location data is
          shared with a web application. This requirement is normatively
          enforced by the [=check permission=] steps on which the

        </p>
        <p>
          An end-user will generally give [=express permission=] through a user
          interface. [=User agents=] with support for [=approximate position=]
          SHOULD allow the user to choose between sharing a [=precise
          position=] or an [=approximate position=]. This choice gives users
          more control over their privacy, allowing them to share a less
          precise location when they are not comfortable sharing their
          [=precise position=].
        </p>

          choice of [=permission/lifetimes=] vary across user agents, but they
          are typically time-based (e.g., "a day"), or until browser is closed,
          or the user might even be given the choice for the permission to be
          granted indefinitely. The permission [=permission/lifetimes=] dictate
          how long a user agent [=permission/grants=] a permission before that
          permission is automatically reverted back to its default [=permission
          state=], prompting the end-user to make a new choice upon subsequent
          use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the granularity of the permission [=permission/lifetime=]
          varies across user-agents, this specification urges user agents to
          limit the lifetime to a single browsing session by default (see
          [[[#check-permission]]] for normative requirements).

          Privacy considerations for recipients of location information
        </h3>
        <p class="note" title=
        "Developers' responsibility with this sensitive data">
          This section applies to "recipients", which generally means
          developers utilizing <cite>Geolocation</cite>. Although it's
          impossible for the user agent, or this specification, to enforce
          these requirements, developers need to read this section carefully
          and do their best to adhere to the suggestions below. Developers need
          to be aware that there might be privacy laws in their jurisdictions
          that can govern the usage and access to users' location data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients ought to only request position information when necessary,
          and only use the location information for the task for which it was
          provided to them. Recipients ought to dispose of location information
          once that task is completed, unless expressly permitted to retain it
          by the user. Recipients need to also take measures to protect this
          information against unauthorized access. If location information is
          stored, users need to be allowed to update and delete this
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In line with this principle, recipients are strongly encouraged to
          request the lowest level of location accuracy that is sufficient for
          their application's functionality. For instance, if an application
          only needs to know the user's city, it should request an
          [=approximate position=] by setting the `accuracyMode` option to
          `"approximate"`. This is preferable to requesting a [=precise
          position=], which is done by either setting `accuracyMode` to
          `"precise"` or by leaving the option unset. This practice of data
          minimization is a key aspect of respecting user privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipients of location information need to refrain from
          retransmitting the location information without the userâs express
          permission. Care needs to be taken when retransmitting and the use of
          encryption is encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients ought to clearly and conspicuously disclose the fact that
          they are collecting location data, the purpose for the collection,
          how long the data is retained, how the data is secured, how the data
          is shared if it is shared, how users can access, update and delete
          the data, and any other choices that users have with respect to the
          data. This disclosure needs to include an explanation of any
          exceptions to the guidelines listed above.

        <h3>
          Implementation considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          Implementers are advised to consider the following aspects that can
          negatively affect the privacy of their users: in certain cases, users
          can inadvertently grant permission to the user agent to disclose
          their location to websites. In other cases, the content hosted at a
          certain URL changes in such a way that the previously granted
          location permissions no longer apply as far as the user is concerned.
          Or the users might simply change their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Predicting or preventing these situations is inherently difficult.
          Mitigation and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
          responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However, in
          designing these measures, implementers are advised to enable user
          awareness of location sharing, and to provide access to user
          interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.

          Checking permission to use the API
        </h2>
        <p>
          <cite>Geolocation</cite> is a [=default powerful feature=] identified
          by the [=powerful feature/name=]s <code><dfn class=
          "permission">"geolocation"</dfn></code> for [=precise position=] and
          <code><dfn class="permission">"geolocation-approximate"</dfn></code>
          for [=approximate position=].
        </p>
        <p>
          When a website requests location access, the user agent [=check
          permission|checks permission=] for the level of accuracy specified by
          the {{PositionOptions/accuracyMode}} option. A grant for the
          "geolocation" permission implies a grant for the
          "geolocation-approximate" permission, while if the
          "geolocation-approximate" is denied, then so is "geolocation".
        </p>
        <p>
          When <dfn data-local-lt="check permission">checking permission</dfn>
          to use the API, a user agent SHOULD present the user with a choice to
          grant access to their [=precise position=], their [=approximate
          position=], or to deny the request. A user agent MAY also suggest
          time-based [=permission=] [=permission/lifetimes=], such as "24
          hours", "1 week", or choose to remember the permission
          [=permission/grant=] indefinitely. However, it is RECOMMENDED that a
          user agent prioritize restricting the [=permission=]
          [=permission/lifetime=] to a single session: This can be, for
          example, until the [=environment settings object/realm=] is
          destroyed, the end-user [=navigates=] away from the [=origin=], or
          the relevant browser tab is closed.

        <h3>
          Preventing Precise Location Reconstruction
        </h3>
        <p>
          A malicious actor could potentially infer a user's [=precise
          position=] by collecting and correlating multiple, distinct
          [=approximate position=]s. To mitigate this risk of a refinement
          attack, when a site receives an [=approximate position=], any
          subsequent calls from that same site within a user-agent-defined time
          window SHOULD return the exact same, cached [=approximate position=]
          data. A user agent might, for example, use a time window of 15
          minutes.

            not supply language or base direction metadata and is only
            localized into English. Developers are advised to use
            {{GeolocationPositionError}}'s {{GeolocationPositionError/code}}
            attribute to create a localized experience.

      <p>
        This specification defines two [=policy-controlled features=]
        identified by the token strings <a>"geolocation"</a> and
        <a>"geolocation-approximate"</a>. Their [=policy-controlled
        feature/default allowlist=] is [=default allowlist/'self'=].

        The "geolocation" policy controls access to [=precise position=], while
        "geolocation-approximate" controls access to [=approximate position=].
        Granting "geolocation" permission implicitly grants
        "geolocation-approximate" permission as well.

      <p>
        Since publication of the Second Edition in 2016, this specification
        received the following substantive changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[=Request a position=] only proceeds when a document is visible, or
        the document becomes visible.
        </li>
        <li>Clarified how caching works as part of [=acquiring a position=]:
        only last position is cached, and can be evicted at any time.
        </li>
        <li>Now relies on the [[[Permissions]]] specification to handle
        permission grants, and user interface requirements.
        </li>
        <li>The `errorCallback` is now nullable.
        </li>
        <li>The API can be controlled by [[[Permissions-Policy]]], which
        restricts how/where the API is exposed to web pages.
        </li>
        <li>The `callbacks` are no longer treated as "EventHandler" objects
        (i.e., objects that have a `.handleEvent()` method), but are now
        exclusively treated as IDL callback functions.
        </li>
        <li>The API is now only exposed in Secure Contexts (i.e., only
        available in HTTPS).
        </li>
        <li>The interfaces no longer use [[WebIDL]]'s legacy
        `[NoInterfaceObject]`, so `Geolocation` and other interface of this
        spec are now in the global scope. Also, the interfaces were renamed
        from `NavigatorGeolocation*` to just `Geolocation*`.
        </li>
      </ul>
