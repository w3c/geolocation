        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <cite>Geolocation API</cite> defines a high-level interface to
        location information associated only with the device hosting the
        implementation. Common sources of location information include Global
        Positioning System (GPS) and location inferred from network signals
        such as IP address, RFID, WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, and
        GSM/CDMA cell IDs, as well as user input. The API itself is agnostic of
        the underlying location information sources, and no guarantee is given
        that the API returns the device's actual location.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an end user [=check permission|grants permission=], the
        <cite>Geolocation API</cite>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides location data as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and
        heading, as well as the accuracy of the acquired location data, and the
        approximate time for when the position was acquired via the
        {{GeolocationPosition}} interface.
        </li>
        <li>Supports "one-shot" position updates via the
        {{Geolocation/getCurrentPosition()}} method and the ability to receive
        updates for when the position of the hosting device significantly
        changes via the {{Geolocation/watchPosition()}} method.
        </li>
        <li>Using the {{PositionOptions}}'s {{PositionOptions/maximumAge}},
        allows an application to request a cached position whose age is no
        greater than a specified value (only the last position is cached).
        </li>
        <li>Provides a way for the application to receive updates about errors,
        as a {{GeolocationPositionError}}, that have occurred while [=acquiring
        a position=].
        </li>
        <li>And through {{PositionOptions/enableHighAccuracy}}, supports
        requesting "high accuracy" position data, though the request can be
        ignored by the user agent.

          Scope
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification is limited to providing a scripting API for
          retrieving geographic position information associated with a hosting
          device. The geographic position information is provided in terms of
          World Geodetic System coordinates [[WGS84]]. It does not include
          providing a markup language of any kind, nor does not include
          defining a new URL scheme for building URLs that identify geographic
          locations.

        <p>
          Since publication of the Second Edition in 2016, this specification
          has received the following changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>[=Request position=] only proceeds when a document is visible, or
          the document becomes visible.
          </li>
          <li>Clarified how caching works as part of [=acquiring a position=]:
          only last position is cached, and can be evicted at any time.
          </li>
          <li>Now relies on the [[[Permissions]]] specification to handle
          permission grants, and user interface requirements.
          </li>
          <li>The `errorCallback` is now nullable.
          </li>
          <li>The API can be controlled by [[[Permissions-Policy]]], which
          restricts how/where the API is exposed to web pages.
          </li>
          <li>The `callbacks` are no longer treated as "EventHandler" objects
          (i.e., objects that have a `.handleEvent()` method), but are now
          exclusively treated as IDL callback functions.
          </li>
          <li>The API is now only exposed in Secure Contexts (i.e., only
          available in HTTPS).
          </li>
          <li>The interfaces no longer use [[WebIDL]]'s legacy
          `[NoInterfaceObject]`, so `Geolocation` and other interface of this
          spec are now in the global scope. Also, the interfaces were renamed
          from `NavigatorGeolocation*` to just `Geolocation*`.

        The API defined in this specification is used to retrieve the
        geographic location of a hosting device. In almost all cases, this
        information also discloses the location of the user of the device,
        thereby potentially compromising the user's privacy.

          User consent
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <cite>Geolocation API</cite> is a [=powerful feature=] that
          requires [=express permission=] from an end-user before any location
          data is shared with a web application. This requirement is
          normatively enforced by the [=check permission=] steps on which the
          {{Geolocation/getCurrentPosition()}} and
          {{Geolocation/watchPosition()}} methods rely.
        </p>
        <p>
          An end-user will generally give [=express permission=] through a user
          interface, which usually present a range of permission
          [=permission/lifetimes=] that the end-user can choose from. The
          choice of [=permission/lifetimes=] vary across user agents, but they
          are typically time-based (e.g., "a day"), or until browser is closed,
          or the user might even be given the choice for the permission to be
          granted indefinitely. The permission [=permission/lifetimes=] dictate
          how long a user agent [=permission/grants=] a permission before that
          permission is automatically reverted back to its default [=permission
          state=], prompting the end-user to make a new choice upon subsequent
          use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the granularity of the permission [=permission/lifetime=]
          varies across user-agents, this specification urges user agents to
          limit the lifetime to a single browsing session by default (see
          [[[#check-permission]]] for normative requirements).

          Privacy considerations for recipients of location information

        <p class="note" title=
        "Developers' responsibility with this sensitive data">
          This section applies to "recipients", which generally means
          developers utilizing the <cite>Geolocation API</cite>. Although it's
          impossible for the user agent, or this specification, to enforce
          these requirements, developers need to read this section carefully
          and do their best to adhere to the suggestions below. Developers need
          to be aware that there might be privacy laws in their jurisdictions
          that can govern the usage and access to users' location data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients ought to only request position information when necessary,
          and only use the location information for the task for which it was
          provided to them. Recipients ought to dispose of location information
          once that task is completed, unless expressly permitted to retain it
          by the user. Recipients need to also take measures to protect this
          information against unauthorized access. If location information is
          stored, users need to be allowed to update and delete this
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipients of location information need to refrain from
          retransmitting the location information without the user’s express
          permission. Care needs to be taken when retransmitting and the use of
          encryption is encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients ought to clearly and conspicuously disclose the fact that
          they are collecting location data, the purpose for the collection,
          how long the data is retained, how the data is secured, how the data
          is shared if it is shared, how users can access, update and delete
          the data, and any other choices that users have with respect to the
          data. This disclosure needs to include an explanation of any
          exceptions to the guidelines listed above.

        <p>
          Implementers are advised to consider the following aspects that can
          negatively affect the privacy of their users: in certain cases, users
          can inadvertently grant permission to the user agent to disclose
          their location to websites. In other cases, the content hosted at a
          certain URL changes in such a way that the previously granted
          location permissions no longer apply as far as the user is concerned.
          Or the users might simply change their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Predicting or preventing these situations is inherently difficult.
          Mitigation and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
          responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However, in
          designing these measures, implementers are advised to enable user
          awareness of location sharing, and to provide access to user
          interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
