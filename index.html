        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Geolocation API defines a high-level interface to location
        information associated only with the device hosting the implementation,
        such as latitude and longitude. The API itself is agnostic of the
        underlying location information sources. Common sources of location
        information include Global Positioning System (GPS) and location
        inferred from network signals such as IP address, RFID, WiFi and
        Bluetooth MAC addresses, and GSM/CDMA cell IDs, as well as user input.
        No guarantee is given that the API returns the device's actual
        location.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API is designed to enable both "one-shot" position requests and
        repeated position updates, as well as the ability to explicitly query
        the cached positions. Location information is represented by latitude
        and longitude coordinates. The Geolocation API in this specification
        builds upon earlier work in the industry, including [[AZALOC]], the
        Gears Geolocation API, and LocationAware.org .
      </p>
      <p>
        The following code extracts illustrate how to obtain basic location
        information:

        Scope
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification is limited to providing a scripting API for
        retrieving geographic position information associated with a hosting
        device. The geographic position information is provided in terms of
        World Geodetic System coordinates [[WGS84]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of this specification does not include providing a markup
        language of any kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope of this specification does not include defining a new
        [=url/scheme=] for building URLs that identify geographic locations.

      <h2>
        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The API defined in this specification is used to retrieve the
        geographic location of a hosting device. In almost all cases, this
        information also discloses the location of the user of the device,
        thereby potentially compromising the user's privacy. A conforming
        implementation of this specification MUST provide a mechanism that
        protects the user's privacy and this mechanism SHOULD ensure that no
        location information is made available through this API without the
        user's express permission.

      <section id="privacy_for_uas">
        <h3>
          Privacy considerations for implementers of the Geolocation API
        </h3>
        <p>
          User agents MUST NOT send location information to Web sites without
          the express permission of the user. User agents MUST acquire
          permission through a user interface, unless they have prearranged
          trust relationships with users, as described below. The user
          interface MUST include the {{URL/host}} component of the document's
          URL. Those permissions that are acquired through the user interface
          and that are preserved beyond the current browsing session (i.e.
          beyond the time when the <a>browsing context</a> is navigated to
          another URL) MUST be revocable and user agents MUST respect revoked
          permissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some user agents will have prearranged trust relationships that do
          not require such user interfaces. For example, while a Web browser
          will present a user interface when a Web site performs a geolocation
          request, a VOIP telephone MAY NOT present any user interface when
          using location information to perform an E911 function.

      <section id="privacy_for_recipients">
        <h3>
          Privacy considerations for recipients of location information
        </h3>
        <p>
          Recipients MUST only request location information when necessary.
          Recipients MUST only use the location information for the task for
          which it was provided to them. Recipients MUST dispose of location
          information once that task is completed, unless expressly permitted
          to retain it by the user. Recipients MUST also take measures to
          protect this information against unauthorized access. If location
          information is stored, users SHOULD be allowed to update and delete
          this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipient of location information MUST NOT retransmit the
          location information without the user’s express permission. Care
          SHOULD be taken when retransmitting and use of encryption is
          encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients MUST clearly and conspicuously disclose the fact that they
          are collecting location data, the purpose for the collection, how
          long the data is retained, how the data is secured, how the data is
          shared if it is shared, how users MAY access, update and delete the
          data, and any other choices that users have with respect to the data.
          This disclosure MUST include an explanation of any exceptions to the
          guidelines listed above.

      <section id="implementation_considerations" class="informative">
        <h3>
          Additional implementation considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          Further to the requirements listed in the previous section,
          implementers of the Geolocation API are also advised to consider the
          following aspects that MAY negatively affect the privacy of their
          users: in certain cases, users MAY inadvertently grant permission to
          the user agent to disclose their location to Web sites. In other
          cases, the content hosted at a certain URL changes in such a way that
          the previously granted location permissions no longer apply as far as
          the user is concerned. Or the users might simply change their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Predicting or preventing these situations is inherently difficult.
          Mitigation and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
          responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However, in
          designing these measures, implementers are advised to enable user
          awareness of location sharing, and to provide easy access to
          interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.

          The intended purpose of this attribute is to allow applications to

            Someone visiting a foreign city could access a Web application that
            allows users to search or browse through a database of tourist
            attractions. Using the Geolocation API, the Web application has
            access to the user's approximate position and it is therefore able
            to rank the search results by proximity to the user's location.

          <h4>
            Annotating content with location information
          </h4>
          <p>
            A group of friends is hiking through the Scottish highlands. Some
            of them write short notes and take pictures at various points
            throughout the journey and store them using a Web application that
            can work offline on their hand-held devices. Whenever they add new
            content, the application automatically tags it with location data
            from the Geolocation API (which, in turn, uses the on-board GPS
            device). Every time they reach a town or a village, and they are
            again within network coverage, the application automatically
            uploads their notes and pictures to a popular blogging Web site,
            which uses the geolocation data to construct links that point to a
            mapping service. Users who follow the group's trip can click on
            these links to see a satellite view of the area where the notes
            were written and the pictures were taken. Another example is a life
            blog where a user creates content (e.g. images, video, audio) that
            records her every day experiences. This content can be
            automatically annotated with information such as time, geographic
            position or even the user's emotional state at the time of the
            recording.

            Show the user's position on a map

          <p>
            A user finds herself in an unfamiliar city area. She wants to check
            her position so she uses her hand-held device to navigate to a
            Web-based mapping application that can pinpoint her exact location
            on the city map using the Geolocation API. She then asks the Web
            application to provide driving directions from her current position
            to her desired destination.

            Turn-by-turn route navigation
          </h4>
          <p>
            A mapping application can help the user navigate along a route by
            providing detailed turn-by-turn directions. The application does
            this by registering with the Geolocation API to receive repeated
            location updates of the user's position. These updates are
            delivered as soon as the implementing user agent determines that
            the position of the user has changed, which allows the application
            to anticipate any changes of direction that the user might need to
            do.

          <p>
            A tour-guide Web application can use the Geolocation API to monitor
            the user's position and trigger visual or audio notifications when
            interesting places are in the vicinity. An online task management
            system can trigger reminders when the user is in the proximity of
            landmarks that are associated with certain tasks.

            Up-to-date local information

          <p>
            A widget-like Web application that shows the weather or news that
            are relevant to the user's current area can use the Geolocation API
            to register for location updates. If the user's position changes,
            the widget can adapt the content accordingly.

          <h4>
            Location-tagged status updates in social networking applications

          <p>
            A social network application allows its users to automatically tag
            their status updates with location information. It does this by
            monitoring the user's position with the Geolocation API. Each user
            can control the granularity of the location information (e.g. city
            or neighborhood level) that is shared with the other users. Any
            user can also track his network of friends and get real-time
            updates about their current location.
