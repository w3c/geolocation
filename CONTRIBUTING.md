Spec development happens via [issues in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/geolocation-api/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/w3c/geolocation-api/pulls). 

For normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later.

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all
contributors in the pull request's body or in subsequent comments.

 To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

 ```
 +@github_username
 ```

 If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

 ```
 -@github_username
 ```

 If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the
 feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
