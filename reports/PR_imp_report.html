      <p>
        This is an implementation report for [[[geolocation]]], covering the
        testable normative changes that were made since maintenance resumed on
        the specification in 2016 until 2022.

    <h2>
      Tested assertions
    </h2>
    <p data-cite="permissions">
      As Geolocation requires explicit permission grant to be used (via
      a browser UI), the following assertions were tested manually to assure
      interoperability across user agents.
    </p>
    <p class="note" title="Why we are not using wpt.fyi">
      As some of the tests rely on the [[Permissions]] specifications
      automation API, which is only partially supported in Chrome, some the
      test were modified locally to get them to pass across user agents.
      However, the working group expects that eventually all user agents will
      support the [[Permissions]]'s automation API and wpt.fyi will reflect

          This can be tested because of limitations of WTP: It would require
          opening multiple browser tabs, which WPT can't do. However, this is
          implemented in all browsers and was manually verified.
