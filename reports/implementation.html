      As Geolocation requires explicit permission grant to be used (via a
      browser UI), the following assertions were tested manually to assure
      interoperability across browser engines.
    </p>
    <p class="note" title="Why we are not using wpt.fyi">
      As some of the tests rely on the [[Permissions]] specifications automation
      API, which is only partially supported in Chrome, some the test were
      modified locally to get them to pass across browser engines. However, the
      working group expects that eventually all browser engines will support the
      [[Permissions]]'s automation API and wpt.fyi will reflect

    <h2>
      Is each feature of the current specification implemented, and how is this
      demonstrated?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The current specification features are implemented across major browsers
      like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. This is demonstrated through the
      aforementioned web platform tests (WPT), which verify the implementation
      of the specification's features, such as obtaining the location, handling
      permissions, and responding to errors.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Are there independent interoperable implementations of the current
      specification?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes, there are independent interoperable implementations of the Major web
      browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari provide their own
      implementations, which have been tested to ensure they conform to the
      W3C's specifications and work interoperability across different platforms
      and operating systems.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Are there implementations created by people other than the authors of the
      specification?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yes, implementations of Geolocation have been created by various browser
      vendors who are not necessarily the editors of the specification. This
      includes engineers from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Apple, among
      others, ensuring a broad base of experience and design input is reflected
      in the API.
    </p>
    <h2>Are implementations publicly deployed?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, the implementations of Geolocation are publicly deployed and widely
      used in web applications. These are accessible in consumer-level browsers,
      allowing developers to incorporate geolocation features into their
      websites and applications, enhancing user experience with location-based
      services.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Is there implementation experience at all levels of the specification's
      ecosystem (authoring, consuming, publishing…)?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is substantial implementation experience at all levels of the
      specification's ecosystem. Developers use the API to author location-based
      services, consumers use these features in daily web interactions, and
      publishers integrate these capabilities into various applications for
      enhanced contextual experiences.
    </p>
    <h2>Are there reports of difficulties or problems with implementation?</h2>
    <p>
      While the core functionality of Geolocation is well-supported, developers
      occasionally report difficulties related to privacy concerns, varying
      accuracy levels, and handling user permissions across different browsers
      and devices. These issues are typically addressed through updates to the
      specification and improvements in browser implementations.
